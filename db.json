It embodies the tacky rind and custardy center, developing only the right amount of stinky goo. Nothing goes overboard; you needn’t worry about alienating half your party by serving a stinker. The yeasty, buttery flavors of Oma, which is aged at the Cellars at Jasper Hill, are enhanced by the saline qualities its rind retains from the washing.\n\nTHE STORY\nNeed I explain? Yes, it is THOSE Von Trapp's who make this cheese. The Von Trapp Farm in Waitsfield, Vermont has been operating as a dairy since 1959. Organic certification came fifty years later. The Von Trapp's are committed to moving dairying to the center of Vermont’s economy, and we have a hunch you'll be seeing new more styles from these guys in the future.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nPickles, especially something crisp and spicy, are the consummate pairing to a washed-rind. Von Trapp Oma loves the snap and tingle of Crisp and Co.’s Ginger Pickles, but can stand up to some heat, too, if there’s pickled chiles in the house. Remember that spice and stink both love the velvety body and sweet fruit notes of a Riesling. ",

Their humble home is north of the Netherlands, close to the icy waters of the North Sea. Although most farmers in the area specialize in cattle and meat production, the Rispens focus on their flock and sustainable cheesemaking.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nEnjoy with pretzels and a pint of crisp pilsner or topped with fruit preserves and a glass of Chardonnay.",

Young wheels of Winnimere are wrapped in a flexible (and fragrant!) inner layer of spruce tree bark and left to mature for 60 days. The cheese is washed with a salt brine during aging, giving the final product an even rind and a soft texture. With notes of bacon and cream, Winnimere is a gooey and creamy cheese enveloped in a spruce-y, woodland hug.\n\nTHE STORY\nJasper Hill Farm is owned and operated by brothers Andy and Mateo Kehler, founded in 2003 in a little corner of Vermont known as the Northeast Kingdom, where the Kehlers spent their summers as children. Jasper Hill has enjoyed major successes with their line of cheeses, such as multiple ACS award wins, including two Best In Shows. The farm recently acquired a second creamery space at the Vermont Food Venture Center, a non-profit facility dedicated to incubating local food businesses. Along with herd management and cheesemaking, another integral facet of the business is the Cellars at Jasper Hill, a state of the art affinage facility, where both their own cheeses and those of other regional creameries are matured.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nTo eat, serve at room temperature to truly enjoy all the creamy ooziness. Scrape off the top layer of rind and dig in with a spoon! Winnimere pairs nicely with a fruity red wine and Speck, to really enhance the bacon flavors present in the wheel.",

Try for yourself!\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nA wintery brie should receive an equally wintery treatment - bake this in a not-too-hot oven with your favorite adornments on top, ranging from honey to figs to nuts.
