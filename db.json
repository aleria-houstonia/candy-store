The aroma and taste are excitingly intoxicating and will have you saying, \"Wow!\" at the first bite. Malto d' Orzo is a very special kind of cheese which serves to rewrite what most think cheese to be. It has a dense, fudgy paste and an alcoholic undertow reminiscent of Italian Rum Cake.\n\nTHE STORY\nMalto d'Orzo is your front row seat to a piano man's boozy, smoky microphone. So, soak it it in. Originally 'butter focused', Beppino Occelli entered the industry in 1976 and currently makes some of the world's most authentic cheeses representing the Italian Alps region of Cuneo. His Testuns pay homage to a very old, rustic style of cheesemaking that utilizes various milk ratios and 'left overs' from other types of food production.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nEnjoy with a Sazerac, Smoking Goose Duck prosciutto (cured with Star Anise), and fresh orange slices.\n\nSKU: CHIT003P",

Thick and textural with a fragrant, bold flavoring due in part to the grappa soak.\n\nTHE STORY\nLocated in Italy’s Piedmont region, the Beppino Occelli company produces excellent mixed milk cheeses that reflect the terroir and traditional cuisine of the region. The cow’s, goat’s and sheep’s milk for these cheeses are sourced locally, through partnerships with shepherds and from the company’s own farm. Milk type ratios in the cheeses differ according to the availability of each milk, reflecting the seasonality of the animals’ natural lactation cycles. Cheeses are aged on shelving made of different varieties of local wood, in both natural and man-made caves in the mountain town of Valcasotto.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nPairs nicely with black tea as a sweet afternoon treat!\n\nSKU: CHIT002P",

Made high in the Swiss Alps using milk from both Brown Swiss and Braunvieh cows, as well as extra cream retained from the dairy’s Appenzeller production, Schnebelhorn is nutty yet creamy, and has flavors of onions, walnuts, and even an aroma of honey.\n\nTHE STORY\nReto Guentensperger is a third generation cheesemaker at his family’s dairy, Käserei Butschwil. When demand for their traditional Appenzeller cheese slowed, they turned their focus to other variants, including Guntensberg and Schnebelhorn. Using milk from high-altitude grazing cows, Guentensperger’s dairy can produce 100 fifteen-pound cheeses per batch.\n\nUSAGE TIPS\nWho’s in the mood for fondue? If you can stand to melt it, mixing Schnebelhorn with a strong Gruyère will have you dipping and dunking veggies and bread until the fondue pot is empty.
